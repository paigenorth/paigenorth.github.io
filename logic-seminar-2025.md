### Description.
In category theory, various kinds of algebraic theories are used to encode and study algebraic objects. The most famous of these are Lawvere theories, which can be used to encode groups, rings, associative algebras, etc. With such techniques one can do universal algebra: in particular, they are a central tool in category theory used to identify nice properties that categories of such algebras have. These days, more complicated variants are important for their tight connection with functional programming languages.

### Prerequisites.
Mastermath Category theory or equivalent.

### Topics and literature.
The primary text we will be following is *Algebraic theories* (Adámek, Rosický, and Vitale). This will cover Lawvere theories and their many-sorted generalization. After reading (the core of) the primary text, we will cover more advanced topics. These will depend on the interests of the participants; the following is a preliminary list of possible topics and associated readings.
- Sketches (_Toposes, Triples and Theories_ by Barr and Wells)
- Essentially algebraic theories and Gabriel-Ulmer duality (_Lokal präsentierbare Kategorien_ by Gabriel and Ulmer)
- Generalized algebraic theories (_Generalised Algebraic Theories and Contextual Categories_, Cartmell)
- Lawvere theories in spaces (_Algebraic Theories in Homotopy Theory_, Badzioch; _On homotopy varieties_, Rosicky)
- Clans and Gabriel-Ulmer duality (_Duality for Clans: an Extension of Gabriel-Ulmer Duality_, Frey)

### Format and evaluation.
The seminar is aimed at master students interested in Logic. There is a maximum number of (active) participants of 10. Participants are expected to give at least three presentations of 45 minutes each. Since each session consists of 2x45 minutes, students work in a "team" of 2, and work in collaboration. Moreover, each team devises 1 or 2 homework exercises, which are solved by the other students, graded by the team. Simultaneously with handing out the homework, the team hands a "model solution" to the teacher. Students are encouraged to give feedback to each other.

If there are few students, we will opt for a hybrid form: seminar/reading group. Every meeting, one of the participants will be responsible for spotting difficulties in the text, gaps in proofs and so on, and for fixing these. This participant (the "speaker") may also be called to present stuffing at the blackboard.

### Learning goals.
After completion of the course, the student is able to:
- convert material from part of graduate-level textbook or a scientific paper into a coherent and comprehensible presentation for fellow students and mathematicians in general
- choose appropriate means of communicating theoretical mathematics to fellow students and mathematicians, in written and oral form
- formulate and grade exercises that keep a balance between relevance, interest, and feasibility
- work together as a team, thereby acquiring collaboration skills
- provide reasonable feedback to fellow students

### Evaluation matrix. 

| | presentations	| homework |
|-|---------------|----------|
|understanding the material	| 20%	| 50% |
| effective communication of the material	| 20%	| 0 |
| formulating and correcting homework	| 0	| 10% |

For "understanding the material (presentations)", we will use the "correctness of exposition" rubric [here](https://students.uu.nl/sites/default/files/beta_wiskunde_bachelor_scriptie_evaluatie-3.pdf) and for "effective communication of the material", we will use the "performance descriptions of presentations" rubric in the same document. For "understanding the material (homework)", points for each part of each homework problem will be clearly indicated by the speaker(s). For "formulating and correcting homework", the default will be 10 as long as the homework is graded in a timely manner, and the students work with the instructor to correct any problems that arise.

presentations = presentations and following discussion
homework = combined output for homework assignments
