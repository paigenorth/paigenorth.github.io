            I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Departments of Mathematics and Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Rob Ghrist. I am also an Honorary Research Fellow in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham.
            Previously, I was a Research Visiting Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department at the Ohio State University, working with Sanjeevi Krishnan.
            Before that, I did my PhD in mathematics at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Martin Hyland, and my BS in mathematics at the University of Chicago.

        <p3>
In my research, I apply tools of topology and category theory to problems in computer science. I am most focused on the connections between type theory and homotopy theory/higher category theory.
