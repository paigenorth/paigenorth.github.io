            I am a Research Visiting Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department at the Ohio State University, working with Sanjeevi Krishnan.
            Before this, I did my PhD at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Martin Hyland.
            Before that, I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.

            I am interested in category theory, homotopy theory, and homotopy type theory. In particular, I am interested in model categories and understanding those which might serve as interpretations of homotopy type theory. In my PhD thesis, I develop the theory of such things - what I call Moore factorization systems for their resemblance to Moore&#8217;s description of the Hurewicz model structure on topological spaces.
